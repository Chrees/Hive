  %h2 Friendly advise: USE THE SHORTCUTS!
  %p You may or may not have noticed, that this site only works well when using shortcuts.
  %p You can use:
  %ul
    %li A to get to the next post
    %li D to get to the previous post
    %li Q to get to the next post in the same category
    %li E to get to the previous post in the same category
    %li S to get to the bottom section
    %li W to get back up to the image
    %li C to hide/show the navbar
    %li X to get back to the index page
  %p I mean, you can use your mouse too if that's your thing, but thats not what I made this page for.
  %p For the best Experience view it in Fullscreen (just press F11 for that if you are on Windows)
  %p I also recommend using Firefox or Chrome for using it, it doesn't really work on Internet Explorer. 
  %p I have no experience with Safari or other browsers, so if it doesn't look right. Sorry ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
